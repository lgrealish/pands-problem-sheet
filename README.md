# Pands Problem Sheet 2023


This repository is used for the problem sets given during the Programming and Scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from GMIT.\
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given tasks, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code.\
I have no previous experience of coding.  In creating this README file I used the following resources as well as consulting with fellow students.

Weekly tasks
======
### ***Bank***

    Write a program that prompts the user to read in two money amounts (in cent).  Both amounts are added together and the answer is printed out in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent amount.

This program is a basic calculation of based on the users input.

User inputs the two amounts in cent. The amounts are added together and converted to Euro and Cent by dividing the total by 100 and is returned as a floating point number rounded to two decimal places.

The [rounding](https://pythonguides.com/python-print-2-decimal-places/) of the result to 2 points was added for a nicer touch although not strictly necessary.
