# Pands Problem Sheet 2023


This repository is used for the problem sets given during the Programming and Scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from GMIT.\

I have no previous experience of coding.  In creating this README file I used the following resources as well as consulting with fellow students.
